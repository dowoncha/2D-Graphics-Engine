Final repository for all COMP575 assignments.

This is a 2D graphics engine done in c++.

Currently it takes a bitmap, and can fill it with either color or other bitmaps.

Has a clear, fillRect, fillBitmapRect, and fillPolygon functions.
FillBitmapRect will be extended to be able to apply transformation matrices to eventually draw a bitmap to a polygon.

Added beginning of Matrix implementation.

TODO:
PA5:
  Start implementing Shaders
PA4:
  Finish up FillBitmapRect
